// Program should halt always after storing 5090 to t3 with a bubble
// It's also testing the stroe functionality.
// Visible in the command line if you search for 'MAYIHAVEYOURATTENTION'
// This also tests jumps both in front and behind the current pc.
// Tests for counter functionality within the BEQ as it should loop 80 times, iteratively adding
//      1 to t1 until it's equal to t3
// LW is also tested as it reads the value it wrote from memory with the same label,
//      'MAYIHAVEYOURATTENTION'
